My friends struggled to come to terms with my mental illness
During my final year at university, I was aged 20, and finally asked for help from my GP. In the words of my younger brother, I’ve always been a bit ‘quirky’. I have a hard time processing emotion sometimes, and I’ve plummeted from inescapable lows to strange highs in a matter of days since my teenage years. I’d spend hours obsessing over the idea that people were laughing at me, worrying about my weight, my appearance, feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. But I remember continuously telling myself, this is how every teenager feels, right? Turns out, not everyone does. I assumed my erratic emotions were the norm, and that my deep, dark moods were simply ‘hormones’ figuring themselves out.

University gave me highs and lows much like in my previous years at home, but my final year it all became too much. I received differing opinions from GPs and mental health, where words like depression, bipolar, anxiety were all being thrown in the mix. This should have made me feel relieved, and at first it did, until I realised what that meant in the eyes of friends. I had and still have a hugely supportive group of friends, close friends that surround me. However, not everybody reacts well to a friend or housemate getting a diagnosis of a mental health condition.

Whilst trying to come to terms with my own mental health, a few close members of my friendship group too struggled with coming to grips with my new diagnosis and where it fit into their own lives. Living with me concerned them, confused a few of them, and ultimately led to irreparable differences. They used words such as ‘dangerous’, and convinced me that self harm was the first step to being able to harm somebody else. Whether they truly believed this or really just didn’t like me very much is something I’ll never really figure out, but a year later I still struggle with the stigma they attached to me that month in my final year, where everything seemed to be spiralling. This eventually lead to me ending up in a hospital bed, plagued with guilt explaining to my family how and why my mind had lead me to such dark places.

Stigma and discrimination for mental health is subtle in many places in the UK, but it is there, lingering and can be really damaging when perhaps a person need’s is support and guidance. Now, I know myself not to be a dangerous person, but it took me a long time to distinguish where my mental illness ended and where I, the person began. Now I have come to realise it is a part of me, and it isn’t going away any time soon. But that’s okay. What isn’t okay, is that both men and women being diagnosed with mental health issues are being spoken to as they are in some way less of a person, less of a productive citizen because of illnesses they can’t control, or don’t know how to. My biggest advice to anybody with a friend or family member with a mental health problem is just listen.

Student environments full of gossip, deadlines and social pressures can be really tough, let alone with a mental illness chucked into the mix. I am now just taking life day by day, am currently off medication and working constantly to keep an optimistic mind-set. I know firsthand how much a reassuring support system can do on those particularly dark and confusing days. I hope to one day be able to take openly about my mental illness with others without worrying about how their image of me will change, but for now, a blog will do just fine.


Workplaces need to understand: healing depression takes time
Travelling through the other side of depression, there’s a sudden realisation that the end of the tunnel, the road to recovery, is achievable.

An only child, dealing with family illness proved tough – even though, at the time, I thought I was dealing with the stress. Both parents and my wife going through serious illnesses (luckily all is well with all) and both remaining grandparents passing at wonderful ages (93 and 101!), it seems all of this piled up on me.

I am a secondary school teacher and, at the time, worked in a school which was losing control. Students bullying staff was commonplace. No support from senior staff made me physically ill. I changed schools – the obvious problem solver?

Yet, bullying continued in the new school. Not from students, but from senior staff. Stress is shown physically in my eczema. My GP even treated me for scabies; such were the severity of the marks all over my back. My GP wanted to see me two weeks later: for reasons I was unaware of. Depression.

He diagnosed me. I took the prescribed medication and attended ten, wonderful, counselling sessions.

Yet, bulling continued. Senior staff had no idea – and didn’t want to know – about my illness. One even dismissing it as “It’s just anxiety...I even wake up in the middle of the night thinking about work.” This ignorance made me feel even worse.

My union and GP recommended long-term sickness. I spent this sleeping in darkness until mid-afternoon, each day. Leaving the house proved difficult. But I wanted to leave the house, go back to work, go back to reality.

The school had a ‘get-rid’ attitude and offered ‘staged’ support. In my state, I could see though this, luckily. But, I had to go through the motions with union support and ultimately was dismissed from my job due to ‘Ill-health capability’.

I had to question: if I was in a car accident, broke my leg, had complications with the recovery and healing process, would the school go through the ‘Ill-health capability’ procedure? Of course not. They would understand the recovery problems and understand time is required to heal. Depression requires time – but who understands that? And how much time? There is no answer to that question.

I was dismissed December 2015 – took a few months recovery/reality time – and signed up with an agency who got me a wonderful job in a school from April to July. Suddenly, the end of the tunnel appears. A school with a human ethos. A supporting network. Reality exists.

Recovery is happening. It takes time. It takes support. My family, in-laws, my wife, friends, were all amazing. I am fortunate to have had that. I hid a lot. Speaking is the answer. Finding who to speak to is the most difficult. Avoid the stigma, dismiss the ignorance, and find understanding – it is there, somewhere; recovery happens in your own time. Discrimination is worrying still there in the 21st Century and this needs to be constantly challenged.

<h1> childtrafficking </h1>
<p>
He introduced her to a woman whose sister lived in Germany. Grace was told that she would have to repay the travel costs by working for the woman’s sister, after which she could work as a babysitter or in a restaurant to send money back home. As she was unfamiliar with German currency, Grace didn’t have an understanding of the amount she would have to repay, but she decided to take the chance because she didn’t have better prospects for her life in her country and her family was pressuring her. As is typical in her community, she underwent aJuju (Voodoo) ritual where she swore never to betray the contact in Germany and that she would pay all the debts.
A “trolley-man” accompanied me and a bunch of other women being taken to various countries in Europe to a hotel to organize our travel documents. I was given the passport of an African woman from a different country and then transported with another woman to Germany. Once I arrived, I was told that my debt was 50,000 euro (around 67,000 USD) which I realized would take a very long time to repay. My family’s contact then told me that to pay the debt, I would be working as a prostitute in brothels (which are legalized in Germany). It was then that I realized that my family’s contact was a madam. I refused and called my parents to explain what was happening, but they told me to obey her and do whatever she told me to do. I didn’t have any papers and didn’t know my rights. She said that if I asked anyone for help, I would be deported, so I didn’t think I had any choice but to become a prostitute. In Nigeria, we respect Germany. I didn’t even think that they did this as a job in Germany; in Italy and Spain, we know there is prostitution. My mother begged me to do what they said. I cried every time a man slept with me, because I was brought up Christian. Back in Nigeria, the father of my son had raped me, and this reminded me of that over and over.
I worked day and night for months, doing everything they asked me, in order to get the money for my madam; and every day I cried. If I came home (I lived with my traffickers) without enough money, my madam would seriously reprimand and abuse me. And, after servicing clients, I would often have to wash dishes and take care of the children in the house. I worked for seven months and was told by my various employers that I had to have sex without condoms when asked. Men demanded sex without condoms. At a well-known legal brothel, the owners told me directly that I had to have sex without condoms, otherwise I would be fired. The owners would ask the clients afterwards if they were happy, if I willingly serviced them without a condom. My madam wanted me to do it without a condom. She said that I was no better than the other girls, and I should do what the brothels wanted to earn more and pay her back. I wouldn’t be able to pay off the debt if I couldn’t work, so I did it. The women here are so desperate for money that they don’t care about AIDS—people here are ready to die. This is blood money, and it was killing me, too.

Seven months after I started, police carried out a check on the brothel and they asked me if I was working there voluntarily. I was very scared and, remembering the oath I had sworn before leaving Nigeria, I said “yes.” They looked over my papers and, realizing they weren’t mine, arrested me and took me to the immigration detention centre. While there I became sick, vomiting, and was brought to a hospital. I found out then that I had AIDS. My madam managed to track me down after I left the hospital and told me that I had to continue being a prostitute to pay for the remaining debt, which she said was still more than half of the 50,000 euro. I refused and she started threatening me and my family back home, who begged me to comply. By then, I had become acquainted withSOLWODI, and they helped me to get settled and exit prostitution. I refused to go back to my madam and eventually reported her and her accomplices to the police.

I am very mixed up now. Sometimes I have high hopes for the future and other times I feel very beaten down. I do not want to go back to Nigeria and I know I would be at risk there. I have a partner now who accepts me for who I am and the support of SOLWODI, which makes me happy. However, I wish people would tell parents that it is good to educate girls and get them proper job training, rather than sending them into prostitution. A child is a gift of God, whether it is a man or a woman.
Women are not slaves and traffickers should stop taking other people’s children. No one should be forced; buyers, pimps and traffickers are killing human beings and spreading sickness. They should prostitute themselves if they want money! Some people are paying 90,000-100,000 euro to buy people. Stopping the sex industry would be the best, it should not exist—that’s blood money!

When I was in the sex industry, I prayed that someone would take me away. If men would be charged, given severe punishments, it would stop.

<h1> bullying </h1>

I was bullied pretty badly in high school. There was one kid in particular who would try to make me feel inferior in every way he knew how. For example, he would throw stuff at me constantly, flick me in the head, punch me, wipe whatever he picked out his nose on my shirt, call me ugly and stupid, mock me and of course – tell me he would beat me up if I ever fought back. It was like his daily mission.

And it was my daily mission to just get through the day. What can I say, it made my world very small because that was my sole focus – just surviving. Everything else fell by the wayside. Unfortunately, that included any form of social life. So not only was my world tiny. It was very lonely.

Looking back to that time – which was about 11 years ago – my biggest mistake was not bringing anyone in to that world of mine. I was too proud (and embarrassed) to get help. I would rather not face the fact that I needed help because in my mind, that would mean that the bully won. It would also mean that I was weak.

Let me just say this – bullying someone is a weak choice. The only reason they come after you is because they think you won’t do anything about it. Does that make anyone strong? Absolutely not. Be stronger – reach out to a parent, a teacher or friend. Anybody. Simply admit that you are struggling and need help.

You can put it like this, “Somebody who is weak and trying to build their self esteem up has chosen to do that by putting me down. The only reason they are doing that is because I am nice and I haven’t done anything about it yet. Well I am through putting up with this. I have basic human rights that they are violating to feel better and that it is just not okay. How do I handle this the right way? I don’t want the pain cycle to continue and become someone I don’t want to be.“

I will close by saying this – I am okay! I am not just surviving. I am enjoying my life. I graduated from college with honors by the way (being stupid was lie…it is all a lie) You don’t have to wait to live though. Do something today.

Bullying started for me when I was in first grade, I had no friends. I would always try to fit in but they would always push me away. In second grade it got worse. Then I had 2 “friends” but after they started insult me. Some people said to the teacher that I insulted them and the teacher belived them. He didn’t ask if i did say it. Just wrote my name on the board showing me big eyes. They only said it because I wanted to be friends with them. Some people would think that Its not that big of a deal but for me it is. Anyways moving on third grade new school but nothing changed. Just one thing new, in this school they whe re even more cruel. I would always end up crying. Its just horrible to live in that moment. It went non-stop until the end of primary. Sometimes they would use me to do stuff for them. I dont why they did it. I AM human like them.

Everyday I wake up and I am scared to speak up about my problems. I go to school seeking an education but unfortunately that isn’t possible due to all of the people who bully me. They constantly abuse me both physically and emotionally. I am sad that I have to share this story but I know that it will help other in my situation.

My bullying story

November 18, 2015
Carolin
When I was in elementary school, I was a very happy and outgoing kid and had lots of friends. But when I started secondary school, some older kids started to bully and tease me. All my friends from elementary school left me because they didn’t want to be seen with me. At my school, everything was all about money and clothes. I had huge glasses and I was really ugly and everyone laughed at me. Then a boy (he was in 8th grade I think) started to follow me around. He called me names, took my stuff and made up rumors about me. One day he and his friends beat me up on the bus. No one wanted to be friends with me anymore. The n I became friends with two girls in my class. They started making up rumors about me. Everyone kept telling me what a bad person I was. In 6th grade, the bullying got even worse. Everyone said I was ugly and I should just kill myself. In 7th grade my mom made me attend afternoon classes (full-time school was voluntary at my school). The kids in afternoon class started bullying me, too. They followed me around and took photos of me in the bathroom to send them to the whole school. When I got home from school, I would go to my room and cry all evening. I never talked to anyone. My grades dropped and my teachers started to talk to my parents. They told them I was lazy and refused to participate. They knew I was bullied but they never did anything to stop it. Everyone hated me and I didn’t have a single friend. I just want to tell everyone who is going through the same: It gets better. I know it’s really hard, and you might feel like giving up sometimes, but you have to be yourself and stay confident. Don’t let them get to you. I know you’re suffering, but at some point you’ll be proud of yourself for all that you’ve been through. And if anyone judges you, it is their own problem. Those people have no idea what you’ve been through. They probably couldn’t even take it. But you had to take it. And you’re still here going on with your life.And that’s why you can be proud of yourself.

When I was a kid, I would always be quiet, and not talk to anyone. But later I got to know a few people and they really helped me with my situation. But then a few days later they turned their back on me because I was different, and they got mad and called me names, so when I went to school the next day I got jumped by four of them and they busted my head open. I still have the scar but it’s hard to see because it’s in my hair, and ever since then I can’t trust nobody because of it. So now I want in on this group so I don’t have to see anyone go through the same thing I did

<h1> child abuse </h1>
<p>
I was 15 when it happened. In the couple of weeks in the run up to the sexual assaults some boys in my year had started picking on people, bullying them and humiliating them in front of others. I tried to distance myself from these bullies but it wasn't long before they turned on me too. It was just words at first but things started to get more physical. I would try and ignore it but it left me feeling angry and alone, I hated them for it.

Like the bullying, the sexual assaults took place in front of others. The feelings of anger, shame and humiliation were so intense. It's difficult to describe them. I was just so angry. I'd never felt that so strongly before. After the first assault I sat in the toilets for about an hour not knowing what to do, trying to control myself. When I came out they were there waiting for me and they assaulted me again. It was like once they had done it they could do it again, anytime. I went to tell someone straight away. I knew then that things wouldn't be the same again.
I couldn't go back to school after that, the thought of it made me feel so tense and wound up. The school made me feel like it was me that had done something wrong as they refused to exclude the boys. I went back in to sit my exams but I didn't ever feel safe. Nothing was done to make sure I didn't bump into the boys who had assaulted me.

I received no counseling or support at all from the school to help me come to terms with what had happened. The head master wanted me to sit down with the boys and asked me to shake their hands. It was a kick in the teeth that he thought all of it could be sorted out with a handshake.

He said it was like rugby locker room banter and that really trivialised what had happened to me. I was scared about what I would do to them too as I was so angry and I felt like I would just snap at them.

I totally shut down after it happened. I didn't see my friends, I would hardly speak or eat. Nothing felt good. I just spent time alone in my room. I struggled to sleep at night and when I did I had really aggressive dreams and they really scared me. They were all about what I would do to the boys if I saw them again. I didn't feel in control. I got flashbacks too - it was like it was always going to be there inside my head like I was some kind of prisoner.

We'd reported it to the police but they didn't refer us for help. My mum took me to the doctors and a student doctor started to cry when they heard what had happened to me. They referred me to CAMHS. They denied the request without even seeing me and just said that my case wasn't severe enough. I just thought 'What on earth do I do now?'
Because I didn't get any help straight away it was all weighing on me and I didn't know how to deal with it. I was just suppressing it for as long as I could but then it would come rushing out and I would go over and over it in my head. The anger was just bubbling up and little things would trigger it. I was scared about what I would do to the boys if I saw them again. I didn't have anyone to talk to about it. My mum was there for me but I didn't find it easy to talk to her, both because I was struggling to find the right words and I felt ashamed; like I'd let it happen to me.

I got help five months after we'd gone to the doctors and it felt like a long wait. I was still so angry that I found it hard to talk, but Sue* was really patient with me. Over time I found the more I opened up and spoke about my feelings, the better it felt.

If I had got help earlier it would have helped me to come to terms with the assault earlier and I could have started to get on with my life. I didn't have the normal stage of going out with my friends and going to parties. It would have stopped the anger bubbling away inside me, and have helped with the flashbacks and dreams, as talking to Sue allowed me to come to peace with the situation and they gradually subsided.

I think all young people who have been sexually assaulted should be able to access help as soon as they need it. I'm so much happier now and I am planning for the future. If you had told me that a year ago I wouldn't have believed you. Talking really did help. It helped me find out who I was and that I wasn't going to let what happened define me. I am far more confident with who I am now. My message to anyone who has experienced something similar is never give up, because life can get better. Mine has.

<h1> abortion </h1>
<p>
Anon, Belfast: I had a medical abortion in Belfast
	
	I read a lot of reviews when deciding if a termination was the decision I wanted to take, so I thought that it was only right that I wrote one too, sharing my experience.

I’m 30 years old have two children a girl 4 and a boy 2, my husband and I hadn’t planned on having any other family and had planned on my husband being sterilized and well you can guess we had an accident.

I Have kidney disease and was very ill throughout my last pregnancy, sick all nine months, getting repeat urine infections and passing out due to low blood pressure.  I was only 5 weeks when I found out I was pregnant this time and already I was vomiting and feeling very lightheaded this lead me to taking a test which confirmed my suspicions that I was pregnant.

I knew straight away that I was not physically or mentally strong enough to have another baby. If I was to be as ill as I was with my last pregnancy I wouldn’t be fit and able to look after my two small children. I don’t have a big support network and I knew I couldn’t continue with this pregnancy. So I made the very difficult decision to have a Medical termination.

So I went to the Marie Stopes Clinic and had a consultation costing £35.00, you met a nurse who takes your medical history, blood pressure, and checks your blood type then scans you to confirm how many weeks you are.

Once that’s done you when decided if you want to have the termination if so you are booked to return.

I returned to the Clinic on Friday morning at 9am paid £390.00, I was met by a nurse who again took my blood pressure checked over my medical history then asked if I was sure this was what I wanted to do, I was so she then proceeded to give me 4 antibiotic tablets, a sickness tablet and then the first abortion tablet. Then I was free to go and return to the clinic at 3pm that afternoon.

After taking the first tablet I didn’t really feel anything no pain or bleeding and was able to go about normally.

I returned to the clinic at 3pm to have the second set of abortion tablets, the same nurse met me showed me and my husband to a booth with two seats and a TV. She then gave me a further 4 more antibiotics and left me for about 5 mins returning with a hot drink (tasted like hot Ribena) this is to soften the gums and make it easier for the next set of abortion tablets to dissolve.

Once I had drunk the hot drink she then gave me 4 quite large tablets which I had to place between my gum and lip, after about ten minutes the nurse then asked me to rub the tablet in a little. After another ten minutes the nurse returned and asked it the tablets had dissolved yet I said that they had and she said I was free to go home, at this point I was feeling fine I got up and went to the exit and waited on the lift.

As soon as I pressed the lift button I started to feel sick, the lift arrived and I got in then I knew I was going to be sick. I vomited three times and felt awful. Lucky my husband had been able to get a parking space right outside the building and I quickly made my way to the car. A was then sick another couple of times.

We began to make our way home and after about 5 mins I started to shake uncontrollably, this was not pleasant but only last about 15 mins then we got home and I got out of the car and I had sudden gush of water much like when your waters break in labour I went into the house got a shower and into jammies and went to bed by this time the sickness was starting to pass and I was on longer shaking, it was at this point a started to bleed heavily this continued overnight and by mid-morning the next day it had lessened to that of a heavy period, this was accompanied by mild to moderated cramp like pains which I used a hot water bottle to soothe. The bleed continued for about a week but lessened each day until it stopped.

This is my experience of how the medical abortion made me feel but from what I have read it varies a lot from person to person. It’s not something that I ever wish to repeat but it’s not as horrific as some of the accounts I read online, at least it wasn’t for me anyway it’s by no means nice or comfortable it's very unpleasant and moderately sore but after 24hrs you feel almost back to normal and are able to go about normal life as if you would with a heavy period.
